Approach:
Used subtring to split and convert the first character to uppercase and the remaining to lowercase. The concatenate function combines both the substrings to generate the expected result.

Code:
select user_id, 
concat(upper(substr(name,1,1)), lower(substr(name,2))) as name
from Users
order by user_id;
